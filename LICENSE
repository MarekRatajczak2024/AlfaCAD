   AlfaCAD is gift-ware. It is created by sole author Marek Ratajczak,
   albeit, like any complex program, it also includes the source code of
   supporting libraries created by other authors, mentioned in the headers
   of the included source files and they are freely available as open source.
   AlfaCAD is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute,
   and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give
   me anything in return. However, if you like this product you are encouraged
   to thank by making a return gift to me. This could be by writing an add-on
   package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the source
   code, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program if it's based on
   AlfaCAD resources, so that other people can learn from them.
   If you redistribute parts of this code or make your own program using it,
   it would be nice if you mentioned AlfaCAD or its author somewhere in the
   credits, but you are not required to do this.
   I trust you not to abuse our generosity.
